When we saw the new LSM9DS0 from ST micro we thought - wow this could really make for a great breakout, at a very nice price! Design your own activity or motion tracker with all the data... We spun up a breakout board that has all the extra circuitry you'll want, like a 3V regulator and level shifting circuitry so it can be used by 3V or 5V power/logic microcontrollers like the Arduino.
